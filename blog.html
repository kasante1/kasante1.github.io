              Series: Stopwords and the Case of Republic v. Yebbi & Avalifo
              [1999–2000] 2 GLR 50.
            </p>
            <p>First draft: 24/12/24</p>

            <h2>So, what is a stopword?</h2>
            <p>
              Stopwords refer to a collection of prepositions, positional
              conjunctions, and other commonly used words. These words appear in
              almost every sentence because they are indispensable for conveying
              coherent thoughts and speech.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, stopwords can produce noise or distort the accuracy of
              several NLP tasks, such as topic modelling.
            </p>

            <p>
              Stopword elimination is a critical feature of any natural language
              processing (NLP) task. Natural Language Toolkit, NLTK and SpaCy
              provide convenient, off-the-shelf access to comprehensive stopword
              collections for the English language—at least to the best of my
              knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
              These indispensable Python packages make NLP tasks, especially the
              elimination of stopwords, significantly less tedious. However,
              there's a caveat: always use domain-specific stopword collections
              in specialized fields.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Ghanaian case of Republic v. Yebbi & Avalifo [1999–2000] 2 GLR
              50 is particularly instructive. While the case raises and
              addresses numerous issues, we will focus on one central question:
              what constitutes 'the public interest'? Here, the Supreme Court of
              Ghana attempted to interpret Article 143(1) of the constitution of
              Ghana which deals with the jurisdiction of the Regional Tribunals.
              It states that:
            </p>

            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                (1) A Regional Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to try such
                offences against the State <strong>and</strong> the public
                interest as Parliament may, by law, prescribe.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              Kindly direct your attention to the presence of the word 'and' it
              has been bolded to make it easy to identify it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now the court had to determine whether or not
              <strong
                >'the word 'and' coming in between 'state' and 'public interest'
                in the provision, is to be read as disjunctive or conjunctive?
                In other words, does it mean that any such offence should be
                against both the state and the public interest;- or is it enough
                if the offence is either against the state or against public
                interest?'</strong
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              This might seem like a trivial issue because why would the Supreme
              Court concern itself with the meaning of the word 'and' in a
              sentence? Everyone knows what the word 'and' means. Well, Yebbi
              and Avolifo's freedom hinges on the interpretation the Supreme
              Court will give to the word 'and'. So in this particular instance
              the meaning of 'and' is a big deal. I am not going to bore you
              with the entire saga of the Republic v. Yebbi & Avalifo.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let's revisit the subject of NLP. Suppose you are a data engineer and your product manager comes to you that
              they need data to train a text classification product. You reach out for an existing stopwords collection to clean the texts quickly. Suppose we consider that any sentence containing the term 'and' is marked as irrelevant in both the training and evaluation datasets. Your guess is as good as mine the
              text classification might decide that the Supreme Court's
              interpretation of 'public interest' in the case of the Republic v.
              Yebbi & Avalifo is irrelevant. Just so you know, your product will
              generate inaccurate results.
            </p>

            <p>This issue is salient in every domain, not just law.</p>
