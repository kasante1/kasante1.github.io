<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.constitutionofghana">Constitution of Ghana, 1992 Plus</a>
<br>
<br>
This app is a simple but reliable reference for an accurate and current

posture of any provision in the Constitution of the Republic of Ghana, 1992.

Interpretation is an essential feature of Ghanaâ€™s legal system. It provides

certainty to some highly contentious aspects of the 1992 Constitution. 

This app was made to make the 1992 constitution and its interpreted

provisions available to the public.

This is an android app on the Google Play Store. I used Flutter + Dart.

This project automatically extracts Arguments, Issues and Holdings from law cases.
I made this with Python.
